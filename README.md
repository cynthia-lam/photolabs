# Welcome to PhotoLabs!
I made this project with lots of love to practice React and full-stack development. PhotoLabs is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to browse, view in detail, and like photos.

# Usage
From the Home Page, users can view photos loaded from the API.

Users can navigate to different photo categories. Users can like a photo from any location within the application, and liked photos are indicated with a heart icon and notification in the nav bar.

Here are the photos from the People topic!
