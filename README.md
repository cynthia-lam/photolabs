# Welcome to PhotoLabs!
I made this project with blood, sweat, and tears to practice React and full-stack development. 

# Photolabs
PhotoLabs is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to browse, view in detail, and like photos.

# Usage
From the Home Page, users can view photos loaded from the API.

Users can navigate to different photo categories (topics). Users can like a photo from any location within the application, and liked photos are indicated with a heart icon and notification in the Nav

Here's the photos from the People topic!
